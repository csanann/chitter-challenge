# 1. Modelling and Planning web application for Chitter Project

0. User stories or specification
User registration:
As a user,
So that I can use Chitter,
I want to be able to sign up for an account.

User login:
As a user,
So that I can access my Chitter account,
I want to be able to log in.

Posting peeps:
As a user,
So that I can share my thoughts with others,
I want to be able to post peeps.

Viewing public stream:
As a user,
So that I can see what others are posting,
I want to be able to view the public stream of peeps in reverse chronological order.

1. Planning pages and a small diagram

Registration page: User can sign up for an account
Login page: User can log in to their account
Peep posting page: User can post peeps
Public steam page: User can view all peeps in reverse chronological order

###a sequence diagram
: one to many relationships: a user can have many peeps, a peep belongs to only one user
User -> Chitter: Register
User -> Chitter: Login
User -> Chitter: Post Peep
Chitter -> User: Display Peep
User -> Chitter: View Public Stream
Chitter -> User: Display All Peeps

3.Test-drive and implement
we will test-drive and implement each route using a test RSpec framework. As our application interacts with a database, we will have to test-drive and implement other layers of the program ie., models and controllers.
